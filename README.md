This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in MongoDB's `updateOne` operation. When updating a document with a field that does not exist, and the `upsert` option is not used, the operation can silently fail. This means the operation will return an acknowledgement of success, even though no changes were made to the document.  The solution shows how to correctly handle this scenario.
